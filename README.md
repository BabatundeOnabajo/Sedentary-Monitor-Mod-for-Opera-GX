# Sedentary-Monitor-Mod-for-Opera-GX
Sedentary Monitor Mod for Opera GX is a "mod" that assesses how long you are sitting in front of your desk. It then gives periodic notifications (default is 20 minutes) of when it is time to get up and go for a walk. One of the benefits of this is that it helps improve the health circumstances of those who use Opera GX, as sedentary behaviour is associated with a wide range of health issues such as cardiovascular disease, eye problems as well as Type II diabetes. It is hoped that adoption of this mod will improve the health of Opera GX users.
